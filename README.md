# RetailMind – Smart Retail Inventory & Sales Analytics System

## Project Overview
RetailMind is a terminal-based Java application that completely digitizes modern retail operations. It serves as an academic capstone, comprehensively implementing advanced Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) without relying on external databases.

## Objectives
Provide an extremely fast, computationally optimal backend architecture capable of managing inventory, executing sales, optimizing warehouse logistics, sorting vast amounts of data, and forecasting financial trends.


## Features
- **O(log n) Inventory Management** via AVL and B-Trees.
- **Fast Analytics** via Fenwick and Segment Trees.
- **Logistics Engine** calculating minimum spanning trees and shortest delivery routes.
- **Business Optimization Engine** identifying highest ROI products using DP and Greedy algorithms.
- **Automated Reporting Suite** providing full executive dashboards.

## DSA Coverage
- Trees: AVL, B-Tree, Segment Tree, Fenwick Tree
- Graphs: BFS, DFS, MST, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall
- Sorting: Merge, Quick, Heap, Counting, Radix
- Optimization: Greedy (Activity Selection, Fractional Knapsack), Dynamic Programming (0/1 Knapsack, LIS)
